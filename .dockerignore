# Keep a local wheelhouse directory (wheels/) in the build context when you want to reuse pre-downloaded
# wheels. To use it, populate `wheels/` in the repo and build with:
#   podman build -f Dockerfile.dev --build-arg SKIP_WHEEL_DOWNLOAD=1 -t python-for-dev .
# If you don't want to commit wheels to the repo, leave SKIP_WHEEL_DOWNLOAD=0 (default) and the builder
# will `pip download` the required wheels into /wheels during the build.

# Optionally ignore scripts if you prefer not to copy them
