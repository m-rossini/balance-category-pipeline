## 🚀 Getting Started

### Quick Start: Understand the Approach (5-10 minutes)
```
1. Read: PHASE_3_EXECUTIVE_SUMMARY.md
2. Skim: COMPLETE_STATUS_REPORT.md Decision Points section
3. Make decision: A, B, or C?
```

### Full Implementation: Do Phase 3 (2-3 hours)
```
1. Review: PHASE_3_DETAILED_CHANGES.md (Phase 3a section)
2. Commit: Phase 2 changes first
   git add -A
   git commit -m "refactor: Phase 2 - mock utilities and fixtures"
3. Implement: Phase 3a (delete dataclass tests)
4. Validate: pytest tests/ -v
5. Commit: Phase 3a
   git commit -m "refactor: Phase 3a - remove redundant dataclass tests"
6. Repeat for Phases 3b, 3c, 3d
```

## 💡 Key Concepts

### Behavioral Testing (vs Implementation Testing)
```python
# ❌ IMPLEMENTATION TESTING
# Tests internal details (how something works)
assert Path(temp_dir) / f"{run_id}.json" exists

# ✅ BEHAVIORAL TESTING
# Tests contracts/promises (what something does)
assert loaded == saved  # Data persists correctly
```

### Contracts (vs Implementation Details)
```
Contract: "The system promises that data saved to the repository 
can be loaded back identically"

Implementation Detail: "The system stores data as JSON files named 
after run IDs in a .metadata directory"

✅ Test contracts
❌ Don't test implementation details
```

### Three Test Tiers

| Tier | Keep? | Example | Reason |
|------|-------|---------|--------|
| 🟢 Critical | ✅✅✅ | "Merge respects priority order" | System behavior |
| 🟡 Important | ✅ | "Quality metrics capture in metadata" | Data integrity |
| 🔴 Low Value | ❌ | "QualityMetrics has all fields" | Already implicitly tested |

## ❓ FAQ

### Q: Why delete tests?
**A**: Tests that just verify object creation are implicitly tested by other tests that USE those objects. Removing them reduces clutter without losing coverage.

### Q: Won't we lose coverage?
**A**: No. The contracts are still tested. Only redundant tests are removed. Coverage stays at 100%.

### Q: Is this a big refactor?
**A**: No. Changes are mechanical and straightforward:
- Phase 3a: Delete 12 complete test functions
- Phase 3b: Replace 4 similar tests with 1 better test
- Phase 3c: Modify existing tests (logic stays same, assertions improved)
- Phase 3d: Combine 3 tests into 1 parametrized test

### Q: Can we do this incrementally?
**A**: Yes! Each phase is independent:
- Phase 3a has no dependencies
- Phase 3b has no dependencies on 3a
- Phases 3c and 3d are also independent
- Do them one at a time and commit each

### Q: What if a test I want to keep gets deleted?
**A**: Each test to be deleted is listed in PHASE_3_DETAILED_CHANGES.md with complete reasoning. Review before deleting and let me know if you want to keep any.

## 🎬 Next Steps

**You need to decide**:

1. **Path A**: Proceed with full implementation immediately? (2-3 hours)
2. **Path B**: Review documents first, then implement? (3-4 hours)
3. **Path C**: Commit Phase 2 now, defer Phase 3? (10 minutes)

**Recommendation**: Path A if you're confident in the approach, Path B if you want full alignment, Path C if you want to consolidate Phase 1-2 first.
