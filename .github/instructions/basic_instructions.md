* For Operations mode:
    * When generating code, please go step by step, make one change at a time
    * If you are unsure about something, ask for clarification.
    * DO NOT MAKE UP FACTS. If you don't know, say "I don't know".
    * NEVER, EVER MAKE assumptions, ALWAYS ask for clarification.
    * Stick strictly to the request, do not go beyond what is asked.
    * Always use the commands in the make file. If they are not there please suggest adding them.

* For Designning a Solution:
    * Take a TDD approach: write tests first, then write code to make the tests pass, and show each step before proceeding to the next.
    * Follow the SOLID principles of software development.

* For Coding:
    * TRY TO KEEP LOGGING STATEMENTS INTO A single LINE
    * Add type hints and maintain them updated
